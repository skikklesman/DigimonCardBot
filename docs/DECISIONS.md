## 2026-07-04 — First runtime dependency: discord-api-types (chunk 0.4)

- **Decision:** `discord-api-types` added as a runtime dependency (the
  dependency policy requires this entry). Also decided: the interactions
  endpoint lives at `POST /interactions` (not `/`), leaving `/` and `/health`
  free; a committed **test-only** Ed25519 keypair
  (`test/fixtures/discord-test-keypair.json`) lets integration tests sign
  synthetic interactions — it guards nothing and is not a secret.
- **Why:** TECH-DESIGN planned it for its interaction-type constants; its
  enums are runtime values, so "types-only devDependency" was not accurate.
  It is zero-network, bundled at deploy (34 KiB gzipped total bundle), and
  maintained in lockstep with Discord's API — safer than hand-copied magic
  numbers.
- **Gotcha recorded:** the package is CommonJS; the Workers Vitest pool
  imports its enums as `undefined` unless pre-bundled — fixed via
  `test.deps.optimizer.ssr.include` in vitest.config.ts. Production esbuild
  bundling handles it fine (verified with `wrangler deploy --dry-run`).
- **Revisit if:** bundle size ever matters (import only the `/v10` subpath) or
  the package goes unmaintained.

## 2026-07-04 — Toolchain locked in (chunk 0.1); Workers Vitest API drift noted

- **Decision:** TypeScript 6.0 (strict), Wrangler 4.107, Vitest 4.1 +
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` 0.18, ESLint 10 + typescript-eslint,
  Prettier. **Zero runtime dependencies.** All dev-only, so no per-package
  justification entries needed under the dependency policy.
- **Drift finding (build-time verification paid off):** the pool-workers
  package dropped the documented `defineWorkersConfig` /
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/config` API in the Vitest 4 era. Current
  wiring is a Vite plugin: `cloudflareTest({ wrangler: { configPath } })`
  from the package root, plus tsconfig types entry
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers/types` for `cloudflare:test`. If online
  docs/examples show `defineWorkersConfig`, they are stale — trust the
  package's own exports.
- **Revisit if:** typescript-eslint's supported TS range (<6.1.0 today) falls
  behind a TS upgrade.

## 2026-07-03 — Documentation set & gate structure established

- **Decision:** Roadmap uses five named gates (Scaffolding Up → First Playable
  → MVP → Feature Complete → Launched); MVP defined as `/card` + autocomplete +
  `/alt` + self-refreshing data + proven alerting + 7-day soak
  ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).
- **Why:** HANDOFF §13's nine milestones were too coarse to track and had no
  explicit definition of "done enough to replace the old bot."
- **Revisit if:** the community's priorities differ (e.g. `/keyword` matters
  more than `/alt`) — see open decisions.

## Open decisions (human input needed)

Carried from HANDOFF §14 plus new ones raised by the roadmap:

| #   | Decision                                           | Default until decided                | Needed by |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1   | Card data source (niamu vs digimoncard.io/.dev)    | Evaluate in chunk 1.2                | Chunk 1.2 |
| 2   | `/alt` in MVP or Phase 4?                          | In MVP (per HANDOFF §1 product goal) | Gate C    |
| 3   | What does the old bot's `/page` actually do?       | Ask community                        | Chunk 4.3 |
| 4   | Keyword data source for `/keyword`                 | Small static dataset in repo         | Chunk 4.1 |
| 5   | Discord app owner: Team vs personal                | Team (per HANDOFF §14)               | Chunk 0.5 |
| 6   | Sync cadence                                       | Weekly Mon 06:00 UTC (HANDOFF §10)   | Chunk 3.6 |
